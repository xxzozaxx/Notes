4 concept

1. Thread: Single unique execution
           {PC, Register, flags, stack, mem state}
        and it exec when it resident which mean {
            1. PC point to instructure
            2. instructure already loaded
            3. stack pointer holds the address of thread stack
            4. etc
        } THE PROG IS RUNING.
        and thread is suspended (not exec) when state is not loaded. and
        at that point PC point to other thread instructures

    Multiple threads run on single core (processor) via multiplex at all time.

    Threads are saved in
            - real (physical) core
            - in mem called Tread Control Block (TCB)

    It's OS work to load and unload threads from core!. and this shift is
    triggered eithr by
              - timer              - I/O
              - Voluntary yield     - others will be discussed

    MULTIPLE THREAD OF CONTROL

2. Adress Space: the ram/mem from 0x000.. to 0xFFF... note that not single bit
        is a valid physical bit (maybe dead bit) but it still valid from porg
        prespective
        in 64-bit processor: 2^{64} address which is 18x10^{18}.

        to help OS to protect himself & protect users from one another we use
        new hardware (B&B: Base & Bound) which is address point to Base (lower
        adress thread can access) & Bound (max add...).
        basically it draw border of each runing thread. also stack address
        should be translated by add to base address (not 100% accurate).

        x86 have more than 2 base&bound there are multiple

        other idea is memory page (review it yourself)

3. Process: exec envi with Restricted Rights
   - Protected Adress space
   - One or more threads
   - Owns file descriptors, fs context,..... aka Resources
   job: PROTECTION, ISOLATION
   PS: communicatoin is easier within a process unlike between them
       as threads within process aren't protected from each other. so
       they are sharing.

4. Dual mode operation: Kernal (supervisor) & User.
   Obviously why
   moderen more layer as hypervisor & docker(container)

   System(kernal) has base and bound of hole mem page.
   user has limited access
